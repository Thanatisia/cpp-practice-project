## Information
### Description
```
Previously this repository was named 'cpp-practice-project', a practice ground for C++ concepts.

However, after consideration on scalability, I have convert this to a practice ground for implementing various programming language concepts 

[Currently implemented]
- CLI Argument parsing, 
- system command calling and 
- working on pipes.

Generally, the aim is to create a centralized write-up/documentation repository to reference whenever I want to implement the above features

- Documentations as to how things works will be added in due time
```

## Language support
### Currently added
+ [C++](languages/cpp)
+ [Python](languages/python)

### Planned/In consideration
+ Golang
+ Rust
+ OCAML
+ Typescript
+ htmx
